//! # rsqlite-core
//!
//! Core engine: catalog, query planner, executor, and the public
//! [`database::Database`] handle.
//!
//! The engine is a tree-walking interpreter. SQL is parsed via
//! [`rsqlite_parser`], converted to a [`planner::Plan`] tree, then evaluated
//! by the [`executor`] against pages served by [`rsqlite_storage`].
//!
//! Most callers use this crate via the [`rsqlite`] facade rather than
//! directly. See `LIMITATIONS.md` in the repo root for the deferred-feature
//! inventory.
